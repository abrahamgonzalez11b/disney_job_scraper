An interactive financial dashboard built with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/) and [Plotly Express](https://plotly.com/python/), designed to display monthly and quarterly budget data. This project is part of my growing portfolio, starting from beginner level and progressing toward advanced data apps.
